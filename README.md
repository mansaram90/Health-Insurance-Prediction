# 🏥 Health Insurance Cost Prediction App

A **machine learning–powered Streamlit application** that predicts **health insurance costs** based on user demographics, lifestyle, and medical history.
This project demonstrates **end-to-end ML deployment**, combining **domain knowledge, feature engineering, model selection, and production-ready inference logic**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Health insurance pricing depends on multiple interacting factors such as:

* Age and income
* Lifestyle choices (smoking, BMI)
* Medical history and genetic risk
* Insurance plan and employment status

This project translates those **real-world insurance risk factors** into a **machine learning pipeline** and exposes it via an **interactive Streamlit web app**.

## 🧠 Machine Learning & Domain Logic

### Key ML Highlights

* Separate models for **younger vs older applicants** to improve prediction accuracy
* **Pre-trained models and scalers** loaded using `joblib`
* Custom **feature preprocessing and encoding**
* **Risk normalisation logic** based on medical history severity

### Age-Based Model Selection

* Applicants aged **≤ 25** → `model_young`
* Applicants aged **> 25** → `model_rest`

This mirrors real insurance underwriting strategies where risk behaves differently across age groups.
The logic is implemented in `prediction_helper.py`

## 🧩 Feature Engineering & Risk Modelling

### Medical Risk Normalisation

Medical history is converted into a **numerical risk score**, then normalised to a 0–1 range.

Example:

* Diabetes → higher risk
* Heart disease → highest risk
* No disease → zero risk

This ensures **medical conditions influence predictions in a controlled, interpretable way** rather than raw categorical inputs.

## 🖥️ Application Interface (Streamlit)

The Streamlit app (`main.py`) provides:

* Structured input forms for all insurance-relevant variables
* Clean grid-based UI layout
* One-click prediction output

Key inputs include:

* Age, income, dependants
* BMI category and smoking status
* Employment status and region
* Medical history and insurance plan

Implemented in `main.py`
